# Hiphen App

## Overview
Hiphen is a Flutter application designed for an ultra-local snack delivery service. This app allows users to store and sell products to their neighbors, fostering a community-centric approach to snack delivery.

## Portfolio Showcase
This repository hosts a simplified version of the Hiphen app, intended for portfolio purposes. The project was developed for an independent contractor client who has graciously allowed its showcase on GitHub. The current (more complete) version of Hiphen is in beta.

## Tech & design
- **Tech Stack:** Developed with Flutter and Firebase.
- **Design:** Given that Hiphen's target customers are mainly college students, I designed the app to be casual, friendly, and bright. There are no capital letters throughout the app and you'll find emojis everywhere ðŸ˜¬.
